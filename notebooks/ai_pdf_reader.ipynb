To mitigate \\ncredit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when \\nthe net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the \\nCompany generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, \\nunder which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of \\nSeptember\\xa024, 2022 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including \\nthe effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion , resulting in a net \\nderivative asset of $412 million .\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\\xa030, 2023  and September\\xa024, 2022  \\nwere as follows (in millions):\\n2023 2022\\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities $ 14,433 $ 13,378 \\nCurrent and non-current term debt $ (18,247) $ (18,739) \\nAccounts Receivable\\nTrade Receivables\\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which \\naccounted for 10%.
