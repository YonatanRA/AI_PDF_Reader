       "Document(page_content='Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies \\nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio \\nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase \\nthe interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \\ninstruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\\xa030, 2023  and \\nSeptember\\xa024, 2022  (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive InstrumentHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022\\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022 \\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \\nvalues of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \\nprohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 \\nmillion and $1.0 billion as of September\\xa030, 2023  and September\\xa024, 2022 , respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying \\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \\nCompany’s foreign currency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2023  Form 10-K | 26', metadata={'page': 28, 'source': '../pdfs/_10-K-Q4-2023-As-Filed.pdf'})"

    "A \"chain\" refers to a sequence of components or steps that are linked together to perform a specific task or set of tasks related to AI or LLMs operations. LangChain is a library designed to facilitate the building and deploying of language applications by chaining together different components such as models, databases, and custom logic. Each component in the chain handles a specific part of the task, and the output of one component serves as the input for the next, creating a seamless workflow that leverages both AI and traditional software methodologies. A chain effectively acts as a pipeline, where data flows through each component in the chain, being transformed, enhanced, or utilized at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, the StrOutputParser parses the model's output directly into a string format. We will use this parser when creating the LangChain sequence; it will be an additional link in the chain, allowing us to directly obtain the LLM's response in string format.\n",

Additionally, the company might choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exposures due to reasons like prohibitive costs or accounting considerations.\\n\\nAs of the specified dates in the provided documents, Apple reported having significant notional amounts in foreign exchange contracts, both designated as accounting hedges and not designated as accounting hedges, reflecting the company's extensive use of these financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.\""

The U.S. District Court ruled mostly in favor of the company, but found certain App Store Review Guidelines violated California\\'s unfair competition law. An injunction was issued to prohibit the company from preventing developers from including external links in their apps for customer purchases outside of Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction, applicable to U.S. iOS and iPadOS App Store apps, is currently stayed pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\n2. **Masimo Litigation**: Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging infringement by the company’s Apple Watch of patents related to blood oxygen functionality. The ITC issued a limited exclusion order against importation and sales in the U.S. of certain Apple Watch models, which is currently stayed pending the end of the administrative review period and the company\\'s planned appeal.\\n\\n3. **General Legal Risks**: The company is also subject to other unresolved legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While some matters were settled in the fourth quarter of 2023 without a material impact on the company\\'s financial condition or operating results, the outcome of ongoing litigation remains uncertain and could potentially have adverse effects if resolved unfavorably. \\n\\nThese legal proceedings highlight the inherent uncertainties of litigation and government investigations, which can have materially adverse impacts on the company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.'"
