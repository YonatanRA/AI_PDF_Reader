    "A \"chain\" refers to a sequence of components or steps that are linked together to perform a specific task or set of tasks related to AI or LLMs operations. LangChain is a library designed to facilitate the building and deploying of language applications by chaining together different components such as models, databases, and custom logic. Each component in the chain handles a specific part of the task, and the output of one component serves as the input for the next, creating a seamless workflow that leverages both AI and traditional software methodologies. A chain effectively acts as a pipeline, where data flows through each component in the chain, being transformed, enhanced, or utilized at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, the StrOutputParser parses the model's output directly into a string format. We will use this parser when creating the LangChain sequence; it will be an additional link in the chain, allowing us to directly obtain the LLM's response in string format.\n",

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed this ruling, and after further appeals were denied, Apple's motion to stay enforcement of the injunction was granted pending a potential U.S. Supreme Court appeal.\\n\\nAdditionally, Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that Apple infringed on patents related to the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. The ITC issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting the importation and sale in the U.S. of certain Apple Watch models, including Series 9 and Ultra 2, effective after December 25, 2023, pending administrative review.
